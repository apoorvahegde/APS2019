Binomial coefficient can be calculated in three ways.

2D array implementation:
It is used when we have to calculate the binomial coeffcient of a large number and we will get results for all intermediate numbers.
Time complexity is (n*k).

1D array implementation:
It is used when we need only the last result. 2D array is compressed in this case and only last row is obtained as answer.
Time complexity is n.
This is efficient in terms of space.

Recurssion method:
Used for calculating binomial coeff of small numbers.

In dynamic approach values are pre-calculated and in recurssion entire calculation takes place.
